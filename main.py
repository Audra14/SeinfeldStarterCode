#import the pandas module and name it pd for easy access

#1. load in the data
#1a. Save filename to variable

#1b. Load filename into dataframe

#2. Check it out
#2a. View dataframe


#2b. Only view first few entries


#2c. View the first 10 entries


#2d. View the last few entries


#2e. View the last 10 entries


#2f. View the number of rows and columns


#2g. View the dialogue column


#2h. View the 10th row


#2i. View unique values and counts for a column (series)
#2i1. Get a column


#2i2. Get unique values and counts


#2i3. Interpret results: Many of these entries have count 1 because they are more than just a character name.  Let's assume character name is in all caps. Extract all uppercase letters from the string using a list comprehension

#We didn't talk about this in class, but see if you can figure out how to nest two list comprehensions to get rid of the outer for loop.  




#2i4 Now that we have a cleaned list of names: remove duplicates, count occurances of each name, and print the top 10 speakers
